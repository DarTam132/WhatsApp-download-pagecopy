          The German Shepherd or Alsatian is a German breed of working dog of
          medium to large size. The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz
          using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899. It was
          originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been
          used in many other types of work, including disability assistance,
          search-and-rescue, police work, and warfare. It is commonly kept as a
          companion dog, and according to the Fédération Cynologique
          Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations
          in 2013.
